-EvalGraph
    Charaters:
        1. evaluate the network and common ratio in our sementic location based network
        2. compare the network and common ratio for popular and random recommending
-NaiveTest
    Charaters:
        user-based recommendation with mllib.ALS
-Models
    Charaters:
        1. baselines for comparing
            1.1 item2item
